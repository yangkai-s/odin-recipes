        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

            </ul>    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
                <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
